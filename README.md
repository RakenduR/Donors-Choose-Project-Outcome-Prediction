# Donors Choose Project Outcome Prediction

This project was done as part of Applied Machine Learning course at SMU.

The outcome of projects on Donors Choose, whether they would be successfully funded or not is identified as a binary classification problem.

The following classification models were trained and the performance analysed. 

* Bernoullis Naive Bayes
* Decision Tree
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Networks

The models were compared and the important features of each model were studied.
